            "## 1. Introduction\n",
            "\n",
            "The objective of this report is to provide a detailed guide on how to implement an automated bug bounty crawling system over eligible domains. This system will be designed to identify and test for common web vulnerabilities using tools such as `requests` in Python. The process will involve setting up infrastructure, configuring tools, and ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards. The report also includes recommended resources for further learning and troubleshooting.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 2. Getting Started\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2.1. Defining Project Goals\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Objective**: Automate the crawling of eligible domains to identify and test for common web vulnerabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Scope**: Focus on vulnerabilities that can be tested using the `requests` library, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and outdated libraries.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Eligibility Criteria**: Domains must be part of a controlled environment, such as internal test domains or test environments.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2.2. prayed Matters\n",
            "\n",
            "- Ethical Use: Ensure that the crawling does not violate ethical guidelines, such as privacy and data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n",
            "\n",
            "- Legal Compliance: Verify that the crawling is conducted within the bounds of applicable laws, such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) for website scraping.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Security Measures: Implement measures to prevent harm to the crawled domains or its users, such as rate limiting and avoiding brute-force attacks.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 3. Steps to Implement the System\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3.1. Setting Up the Environment\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Use a disposable VM (e.g., Vagrant) to test the crawler in a controlled environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Docker**: Consider using Docker for containerization to facilitate easy setup and scaling of the crawling infrastructure.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Proxy Usage**: Integrate a proxy service (e.g., socks library in Python) to rotate between multiple IPs to avoid detection and mimic different geographies.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3.2. Defining the Crawler\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Tool Selection**: Use `scrapy` or `beautifulsoup` for web crawling and parsing. For complex or incomplete websites, `scrapy` is recommended due to its scalability.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Custom Scraper**: Implement a custom scraper that follows links and pages on the domain being crawled.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Crawling Strategy**: Define a strategy for how the crawler proceeds, such as depth-first or breadth-first.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3.3. Identifying Vulnerabilities\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Predefined Checks**: Test for known vulnerabilities using predefined checks, such as outdated libraries (e.g., using `osscan` for quick vulnerability detection).\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Custom Checks**: Implement custom checks for XSS, SQL injection, and other common vulnerabilities. For example, for SQL injection, send varying parameters to a public endpoint to see if untrusted data is passed directly to the database.\n",
            "\n",

By following the steps and utilizing the right tools, organizations can effectively identify and test for common web vulnerabilities. The system should be continuously monitored and updated to stay ahead of emerging threats. Finally, it is crucial to ensure that all activities are conducted ethically and legally to avoid legal complications and harm to the crawled domains or their users.\n"
